"""
Integration tests for POST /analyze with a live Redis.

These tests verify that app.py correctly reads from and writes to Redis
using real network I/O — not mocks.  The LLM/agent is still mocked because
we are testing the app ↔ Redis boundary specifically, not the LLM.

What these tests prove that unit tests cannot:
  - The cache key written by app.py is exactly the key that get() finds.
  - The JSON stored in Redis is well-formed and retrievable by a second request.
  - The agent is truly skipped on a cache hit — not just in mocked logic.

Run with:  pytest tests/integration/
Requires:  docker run -p 6379:6379 redis:7
